Share-Some: Towards Zero Food Waste

Share-Some is a mobile application developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2024 (SIH1588) to address the critical issue of food wastage in India. Our platform connects donors with surplus food, such as hotels and event organizers, to beneficiaries like old age homes, orphanages, and other people in need.

Problem
In India, approximately 40% of the food produced, amounting to 70 million tons annually, goes to waste. This results in a staggering economic loss of ‚Çπ92,000 crores each year, while millions continue to suffer from hunger and malnutrition. Share-Some aims to bridge this gap by creating an efficient food redistribution network.

üéØ Key Features
AI-Powered Matching: An intelligent system suggests the most suitable recipients for a donation based on food requirements, and other factors.

Real-Time Communication: An in-app messaging service, powered by Socket.io, allows for seamless coordination between donors and recipients.


Volunteer Scoring System: A gamified system rewards and recognizes volunteers based on their service, with a community wall to showcase top contributors.

Integrated Chatbot: A helpful chatbot assists users with registration, posting donations, arranging pickups, and answering frequently asked questions.

Quality & Trust: A feedback system allows recipients to rate the quality of the food, ensuring high standards and building trust within the community.

NGO Collaboration: NGOs can identify individuals in hunger spots without access to technology and coordinate food collection.
